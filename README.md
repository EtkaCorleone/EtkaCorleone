Hi, I’m @EtkaCorleone
I'm a game maker and we've just started making games with my team. 
Designing a game and seeing it on the screen is what I enjoy the most. 
My team and I are developing games using the C++ software language via the Unreal Engine.
This GitHub account is a starting point before my gaming company, which I will open in the future.
In the future, when my game is chosen as the game of the year, this article will gain value.
 . . .
 Thanks !
